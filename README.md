# Employee Management System - Spring Boot REST API

This project is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot for managing employee data. It provides standard CRUD operations and implements Spring Security for role-based access control.

## Features

* **Retrieve all employees:** `GET /api/employees` (Requires EMPLOYEE role)
* **Retrieve employee by ID:** `GET /api/employees/{employeeId}` (Requires EMPLOYEE role)
* **Create a new employee:** `POST /api/employees` (Requires MANAGER role)
* **Update an employee:** `PUT /api/employees/{employeeId}` (Requires MANAGER role)
* **Delete an employee:** `DELETE /api/employees/{employeeId}` (Requires ADMIN role)
* Role based authentication with Spring security.
* Uses a relational database.

## Technologies Used

* Spring Boot
* Spring Security
* JDBC
* Rest Api

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
   * Java 17 or higher
   * A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
   * Maven or Gradle
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository Link]
    ```
3.  **Configure the database:**
   * Update the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with your database connection details.
   * Ensure that your database contains the required tables for users and employees.
4.  **Build and run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    Or if you are using gradle.
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
5.  **Access the API:**
   * The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api`.

## Security

* Spring Security is configured to use role-based access control.
* Users and roles are managed through the database.
* HTTP Basic authentication is used.

## Usage

Use a REST client (like Postman or curl) to interact with the API endpoints.
